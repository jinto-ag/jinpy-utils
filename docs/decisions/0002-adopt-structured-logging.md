# ADR-0002: Adopt Structured Logging Architecture

**Status:** ✅ Accepted
**Date:** 2025-08-12
**Authors:** Development Team

## Context

The project needed a robust logging system that could handle various output formats, multiple backends, and structured data. Traditional Python logging was insufficient for modern observability requirements.

Key requirements:
- Support for structured data (JSON, key-value pairs)
- Multiple output backends (console, file, REST API, WebSocket)
- Environment-specific configurations
- Type-safe configuration
- Performance optimization

## Decision

Implement a **custom structured logging system** with:
- Pydantic-based type-safe configuration
- Multiple pluggable backends
- Structured data support
- Environment-specific presets

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Standard Python Logging
- **Pros:** Built-in, widely known, simple
- **Cons:** Limited structured data support, poor type safety, rigid configuration
- **Why not chosen:** Insufficient for modern observability needs

### Option 2: Loguru
- **Pros:** Great API, structured logging, good performance
- **Cons:** External dependency, less control over architecture
- **Why not chosen:** Wanted more control over backend architecture

### Option 3: structlog
- **Pros:** Excellent structured logging, mature
- **Cons:** Complex configuration, learning curve
- **Why not chosen:** Too complex for our use case

## Rationale

- **Type Safety**: Pydantic ensures configuration correctness at runtime
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture allows custom backends
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput scenarios
- **Developer Experience**: Simple API with powerful configuration
- **Observability**: Structured data enables better monitoring and debugging

## Consequences

### Positive
- Type-safe configuration prevents runtime errors
- Structured logging improves observability
- Multiple backends support various deployment scenarios
- Environment presets simplify configuration
- Async support for high-performance scenarios

### Negative
- Custom implementation requires maintenance
- Learning curve for team members
- More complex than simple print statements

### Neutral
- Additional dependency on Pydantic
- Larger codebase than using existing solutions

## Implementation

1. ✅ Core Logger class with registry pattern
2. ✅ Pydantic configuration models
3. ✅ Multiple backend implementations (Console, File, REST, WebSocket)
4. ✅ Environment-specific configuration presets
5. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
6. ✅ Documentation with examples

# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format - a lightweight standard for documenting architectural decisions.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document important decisions made during development, including:
- **Context** - What situation led to this decision
- **Decision** - What was decided
- **Rationale** - Why this decision was made
- **Consequences** - What are the trade-offs and impacts
